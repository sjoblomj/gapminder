Gapminder Clone
===============

A data visualisation of the development of 200 countries over 200 years. This is a clone of the presentations that
[professor Hans Rosling and the Gapminder Foundation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbkSRLYSojo) have made famous
in TED talks and elsewhere.

The visualisation shows the Life Expectancy and Income per person. Each country is a bubble where the size reflects the
population size.

The visualisation is written in Javascript using the [D3.js library](https://d3js.org/).
